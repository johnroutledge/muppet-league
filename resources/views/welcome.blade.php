                                In the delightful world of Muppet League, you don't need to possess the tactical brilliance of Pep Guardiola 
                                or the charismatic touch of Jurgen Klopp to excel. Quite the opposite, in fact! The name of the game is to 
                                assemble a squad that's so gloriously inept that it would make even the most seasoned football manager shake 
                                their head in bewilderment.
                            </p>

                                Your goal isn't to score goals 
                                but to select players who seem to have forgotten the very essence of the beautiful game. So, grab your tea, 
                                don your silliest hat, and embark on a whimsical journey where own goals are celebrated, and the offside 
                                rule is a mere suggestion. Welcome to Muppet League, where winning is for the birds, and chaos reigns supreme!
